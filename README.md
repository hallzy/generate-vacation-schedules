#Possible Vacation Schedules

Given a start date, an end date, and the minimum and maximum length of time for
a vacation, produces a file that gives all possible combinations from longest
time to shortest.

##Usage

Note that I have only tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

###Windows

I have not found a way to get this to work on Windows so far.

I have tried Cygwin, but the script does not seem to execute properly here.


### Mac OSX or Linux

Download the project as a Zip file to your desktop.

Open a terminal and enter these commands:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
./possible-vacation-schedules
```

Answer the questions that you are prompted for with numbers only.

When the script is done, a statement that says "Done!" will appear.

At this point a file called "schedule.txt" will be on you desktop screen. You
can close the terminal and open this text file to see the schedules that fit
your requirements.
